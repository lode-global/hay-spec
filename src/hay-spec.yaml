title: Hay Description Specification
version: 0.90.0
status: draft
publisher: Lode

description: >
  A structured data model for describing hay in a standardized, machine-readable format.
  Developed to improve clarity, consistency, and efficiency in how hay is characterized,
  traded, and analyzed-whether in domestic or international markets.

introduction: >
  Hay is a foundational agricultural commodity, essential to the nutrition of dairy and beef cattle,
  horses, goats, camels, sheep, and other animals. In the United States, hay ranks among the leading
  cash crops by annual sales value, alongside corn, wheat, and soybeans. Yet unlike those crops, hay
  is traded entirely on an over-the-counter basis-through peer-to-peer negotiation, dealers, or brokers-
  without common product definitions or standardized digital tools.

  The hay market does not inherently require centralized exchanges to function well. But it does suffer
  from two critical deficiencies:
    1. Buyers and sellers struggle to find one another efficiently.
    2. There is limited electronic facilitation of trading, particularly in matching, documentation, and decision support.

  These limitations stem in part from the lack of shared standards. Without consistent product descriptions
  or data conventions, hay listings and negotiations rely on informal descriptions, resulting in persistent
  mismatches in perceptions of quality, weak price signals, and high friction in trade. This hinders regional
  and global commerce, limits market transparency, and slows investment in modern tools for production,
  logistics, testing, and quality control.

  Efforts to standardize hay go back more than a century. As recently as the late 19th century, centralized hay
  markets operated in cities such as Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. Since then, producer groups, academic
  institutions, extension agencies, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have all proposed grading systems.
  But none has achieved enduring, widespread adoption.

  Several developments now offer new opportunities for progress:
    - Hay exports are growing, especially alfalfa, which now trades across borders under increasingly formalized standards.
    - Testing technologies have matured, including laboratory-based wet chemistry and NIR spectroscopy.
    - Digital tools and platforms are emerging, enabling traceability from field to bale.
    - Online infrastructure allows global coordination, opening the door for community-led standards and interoperability.

  This document proposes a formal product definition for hay-a structured data model that captures economically
  salient characteristics in a consistent format. Such a definition supports better listings, search, comparison,
  and traceability. Over time, it may also surface replacements in market behavior that inform the development of accepted grading practices.

  This specification is published by Lode, a platform for improving transparency and connectivity in agricultural
  commodities markets. To participate or provide feedback, contact us at [insert email address] or visit lode.global.

  This is a working draft subject to field testing and stakeholder refinement.

  Planned additions include:
    - A reference dataset of forage varieties, with identifiers and metadata.
    - A registry of forage analysis laboratories supporting the specified testing methods and protocols.

field_naming_conventions:
  summary: >
    All field names in this specification follow these conventions:
  rules:
    - All lowercase letters (a-z)
    - Words separated by a single underscore (_)
    - No spaces, hyphens, slashes, or special characters
    - Scientific abbreviations normalized to lowercase (e.g., ph, ppm, tdn)
    - Numerical qualifiers separated by underscores (e.g., 1x, 3x)
    - Units of measure placed at the end, separated by underscores (e.g., mcal_lb, percent_dm)
    - No trailing or double underscores
  example: digestible_energy_1x_mcal_lb

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cross-field consistency guidance
#
# Some sections in this specification include YAML comments labeled as
# "Cross-field consistency guidance." These comments offer examples of expected
# relationships between values across different fields within the same section.
#
# These are not validation rules--they are heuristics intended to support:
#   - Improved data quality
#   - Better interoperability between systems
#   - Enhanced user interfaces and data entry support tools
#
# For example:
#   - If `organoleptic_factor_moldy` is true, then `organoleptic_factor_odor` is often `Moldy`
#   - If `foreign_material_weeds` is true, buyers may infer that `certified weed free` is likely false
#
# These comments are placed near the relevant fields for convenience and
# should be interpreted as advisory, not normative.

    title: Traceability
    description: >
      This section captures whether the hay can be traced to a clearly defined production lot and
      whether formal identifiers exist that facilitate lot-level tracking, recall, or certification.
      Traceability is increasingly important in high-value or regulated markets, as it supports inventory
      segregation, quality assurance, documentation of origin, and post-sale issue resolution.

    fields:
      - id: hay_single_lot_traceable
        data_type: boolean
        valid_values: [true, false]
        definition: >
          Affirms whether the hay being described originates from a single, defined lot, harvested under
          uniform agronomic and environmental conditions. A lot is defined as "forage taken from the same
          farm, field, and cut under uniform conditions within a 48-hour time period," as described in
          Ball et al. (2001).

          This designation supports clarity in nutritional representation, quality assessment, and logistical consistency.
        notes:
          - "This field represents a binary value: `true` if traceable to a single, defined lot; `false` otherwise."
          - "Common use in export markets and quality certification workflows."

            author: Ball et al. (2001)

      - id: lot_identifier_internal
        data_type: string
        valid_values: free-text, max 100 characters
        definition: >
          This field allows the seller to assign an internal identifier to the lot from which the hay originated.
          It may reflect farm, field, cutting, or date conventions relevant to the seller's operation.
          Systems should enforce a character limit of 100 to ensure consistency and compatibility.

          Internal lot identifiers do not need to conform to any industry standard but should be unique
          within the seller's system. They may be used for inventory management, customer reference,
          and traceability across quality or testing modules.

      - id: lot_identifier_external
        data_type: component
        definition: >
          A structured block consisting of two related fields: an externally issued lot identifier and
          the name of the organization or program that issued it. Used for regulatory or certification purposes.

        components:
          - id: lot_identifier_external.value
            data_type: string
            valid_values: free-text, max 100 characters
            definition: >
              This field records the externally issued lot identifier assigned to the hay or forage lot by a
              regulatory, certifying, or export authority. Its meaning depends on the associated
              lot_identifier_external.issuer field, which specifies the issuing organization.

              External lot identifiers may appear on documents such as:
                - Organic certificates (e.g., USDA NOP Lot #12345)
                - Phytosanitary inspection reports
                - Export documents or permits
                - Weed-free forage program tags or declarations

              The value may include letters, numbers, or a combination thereof. Systems should enforce a
              maximum of 100 characters and preserve the identifier exactly as provided by the issuing body,
              including any dashes, slashes, or formatting symbols.

              This field enhances traceability and may support validation workflows, especially in regulated
              or export-focused markets.

          - id: lot_identifier_external.issuer
            data_type: enum
            valid_values:
              - USDA
              - CFIA
              - State agriculture department
              - Export certification agency
              - Organic certifier
              - Weed-free program
              - Other
            definition: >
              Identifies the organization or program that issued the external lot identifier.

              Common issuers include:
                - USDA - e.g., for organic certification or phytosanitary control
                - CFIA - Canadian Food Inspection Agency
                - State agriculture department - e.g., for weed-free programs or grading systems
                - Export certification agency - country-of-destination compliance
                - Organic certifier - under USDA NOP or equivalent programs
                - Weed-free program - e.g., NAISMA-affiliated
                - Other - custom or less common issuers

              This structure allows systems and reviewers to assess the origin and regulatory weight of
              the identifier and may support future API integrations or document uploads.

      - id: lot_mapping_field_to_bale_supported
        data_type: boolean
        valid_values: [true, false]
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the seller maintains a system (digital or physical) for mapping specific
          bales or sub-lots to field-level characteristics, such as GPS coordinates, yield zones, or
          harvest time blocks.

          Such mapping enables greater traceability, enhances data resolution for quality control,
          and may support integration with field data platforms or precision agriculture systems.

          This capability is optional but increasingly valuable in transparent or regulated feed markets.

    guidance: >
      Traceability fields should be completed to the extent feasible. While not all buyers require formal lot tracking,
      inclusion of traceability data - especially internal and external identifiers - can streamline certification
      workflows, support inventory segregation, and build buyer confidence.

      Systems should validate consistency between hay_single_lot_traceable and identifier fields and may allow
      optional linking to field- or bale-level metadata for advanced users.

  - id: stand
    title: Stand Composition and Agronomic Characteristics
    description: >
      This section describes the planted forage stand-the biological and agronomic foundation of the hay crop.
      It includes the intended composition of plant varieties, their representation in the harvested hay, and
      related agronomic details such as establishment method, density, and maturity at harvest.

      These fields support transparency around crop planning, species selection, and cultural practices,
      helping buyers assess the identity, uniformity, and development stage of the forage. The section also
      captures information relevant to quality, palatability, and intended use, and it helps agricultural
      professionals interpret how the hay's characteristics relate to field management decisions.

    fields:
      - id: stand_mixture_intended
        data_type: boolean
        valid_values: [true, false]
        definition: >
          This field expresses whether the grower intended to plant a mixed stand (polyculture)
          or a pure stand (monoculture) of forage species.

          A value of `true` indicates the intention to grow a mix of species or varieties;
          a value of `false` indicates a monoculture was intended.

          This field captures grower intent and does not reflect the final outcome, which may differ
          due to environmental or agronomic factors. For example, a grower may plant an alfalfa/timothy
          mix, but only the timothy survives to harvest. This field would still be `true`.

          This field pairs with `forage_species_type`, which records the actual species composition
          of the forage at harvest, and with the `hay_variety_instances` group, which captures the
          grower's target and achieved representation of each variety.

      - id: forage_species_type
        data_type: enum
        valid_values:
          - grass
          - legume
          - grass/legume mix
          - other
        definition: >
          This field describes the biological classification of the forage species present in the hay at harvest.
          It reflects the actual or observed composition, rather than the grower's original intention.

          - `grass`: The hay consists primarily of grasses, such as bermudagrass or orchardgrass.
          - `legume`: The hay consists primarily of legumes, such as alfalfa or clover.
          - `grass/legume mix`: Both grasses and legumes are present in significant proportion.
          - `other`: The forage does not fit into the above categories (e.g., brassicas, forbs, or specialty hays).

          This field supports downstream applications such as nutritional analysis, ration formulation, and marketing.
          It is best determined based on post-harvest visual inspection or lab analysis, and complements
          `stand_mixture_intended`.

      - id: forage_variety_count
        data_type: int
        valid_values: positive integer (0 or greater)
        definition: >
          This field reports how many distinct forage varieties were identified in the actual harvested crop.
          It supports both marketing claims (e.g., "two-variety blend") and technical purposes, such as determining
          how many instances of a `forage_variety_component` block will be included in a structured message.

          This field reflects actual harvest outcome, not grower intent. By contrast, `stand_mixture_intended`
          expresses whether the grower intended a mixed or pure sward. These two fields together help distinguish
          between intent and result.

          In a pure crop, this field should take a value of `1`. In a mixed crop, this field should take a value of
          `2` or more. If no species or varieties can be positively identified, the value should be `0`, and the
          `forage_species_type` should be set to `unknown`.

          System validations may check for consistency across `stand_mixture_intended`, `forage_variety_count`,
          and any listed `forage_variety_component` entries.

      - id: forage_variety_components
        data_type: list
        item_type: component
        definition: >
          This block describes each intentionally planted forage variety in the hay sward.
          Pure (monoculture) hay includes one instance; mixed (polyculture) hay includes two or more.

          Each entry should reflect the grower's intention, variety name, and estimated contribution to
          the harvested crop. This supports both agronomic analysis and marketplace transparency.

          Use this block in combination with `forage_variety_count` and `stand_mixture_intended` to
          document crop composition and stand complexity.

        components:
          - id: forage_variety
            data_type: enum
            valid_values: reference list of forage species, subspecies, or named varieties
            definition: >
              Enter the full name of the forage variety, such as `Tifton 85 bermudagrass` or `Vernal alfalfa`.
              When possible, include binomial nomenclature, common name, and GMO status if known or relevant.

              Standardizing variety names supports better market searchability, agronomic traceability,
              and nutrient expectation setting.

          - id: variety_representation_target
            data_type: int
            valid_values: whole number ratio (non-negative)
            definition: >
              Captures the intended proportion of a given forage variety in the seed mix or planting strategy.
              Use whole-number ratios to reflect seeding intent. For example, if the mix was designed to be
              3 parts orchardgrass and 1 part alfalfa, enter `3` for orchardgrass and `1` for alfalfa.

              This is not a percentage and does not need to sum to 100 - it expresses relative ratios.
              Systems can calculate proportional percentages from totals.

              Helps buyers and agronomists understand the seeding strategy, even when outcomes differ due
              to growing conditions or stand establishment issues.

          - id: variety_representation_result
            data_type: int
            valid_values: integer percentage (0-100)
            definition: >
              Captures the observed contribution of this variety in the finished hay.
              Enter a whole number percentage (e.g., `65` for 65%), based on visual inspection,
              lab results, or grower knowledge.

              This value reflects real-world outcome and may differ from `variety_representation_target`
              due to environmental or agronomic factors.

              Total values across all components should sum to approximately 100%, with minor discrepancies
              acceptable for estimated inputs.

      - id: stand_maturity_at_harvest
        data_type: enum
        conditional_enums:
          grass:
            applies_to: grass-dominant stands
            values:
              - vegetative
              - early head
              - mid head
              - full head
              - post-head
          legume:
            applies_to: legume-dominant stands (e.g., alfalfa or clover)
            values:
              - vegetative
              - bud
              - early bloom
              - full bloom
              - post-bloom
        definition: >
          Records the predominant maturity stage of the forage stand at the time of harvest.
          Maturity at harvest strongly influences forage quality, including digestibility, fiber content,
          and crude protein.

          Use the appropriate maturity scale depending on the crop's dominant species type:

            - **Grass scale**: Used for species like bermudagrass, orchardgrass, or timothy.
            - **Alfalfa (legume) scale**: Used for alfalfa or clover-dominant stands.

          Selection of the correct maturity stage helps buyers and nutritionists anticipate hay characteristics
          and plan optimal livestock feeding strategies.

      - id: stand_establishment_method
        data_type: enum
        valid_values:
          - drilled
          - broadcast
          - no-till
          - sod-seeded
          - unknown
        definition: >
          Indicates the method used to establish the forage stand.
          Establishment method can affect plant density, weed suppression, and long-term stand performance.

      - id: stand_establishment_date
        data_type: datetime
        valid_values: YYYYMMDD format (allow 00 for unknown day or month)
        definition: >
          Records the date on which the forage stand was planted or sown.

          If the exact day is unknown, use `00` in the day field.
          If both day and month are unknown, use `00` in both (e.g., `20240000`).

          Example:
            - `20240400` -> planted in April 2024 (day unknown)
            - `20240000` -> planted sometime in 2024 (month and day unknown)

      - id: stand_density
        data_type: enum
        valid_values:
          - sparse
          - moderate
          - dense
          - unknown
        definition: >
          Qualitatively assesses the density of the forage stand at the time of harvest.
          Higher density can indicate better competition with weeds and improved yield.

      - id: source_stand_age
        data_type: int
        valid_values: non-negative integer (0 or greater)
        definition: >
          Records the number of years the current forage stand has been in place at the time of harvest.
          It reflects how long the same root system and plant population have been producing harvestable
          hay from the same field without replanting or reseeding.

          Newly established stands may offer better vigor and fewer weeds, while older stands may show
          declining productivity, species composition shifts, or increased weed pressure.

          Enter `0` if this is the first year of the stand's establishment. This field is especially important
          for perennial forages such as alfalfa, bermudagrass, or orchardgrass.

  - id: location
    title: Field Location and Growing Environment
    description: >
      This section describes the field location and environmental characteristics where the hay was produced.
      Geographic factors play a significant role in hay quality, influencing aspects such as nutrient content,
      texture, and palatability. Elevation, climate classification, and irrigation infrastructure all shape
      growing conditions and harvesting outcomes.

      These fields support traceability, enable regional comparisons, and help buyers assess how site-specific
      factors may affect hay performance for their intended use.

    fields:
      - id: hay_origin_country_code
        data_type: string
        valid_values: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (2-character string)
        definition: >
          Specifies the country in which the hay was produced, using the standardized ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code set.
          Examples include `US` for the United States, `CA` for Canada, and `MX` for Mexico.

          Using this internationally recognized format allows for consistent and automated identification of
          national origin across systems and jurisdictions. This field supports traceability, compliance with
          import/export requirements, and transparency for buyers concerned with geographic sourcing.

          System interfaces may implement dropdown menus or auto-complete fields linked to an official
          ISO 3166-1 code list to minimize input errors.

        references:
          - title: ISO 3166-1 country codes

      - id: hay_origin_subdivision_code
        data_type: string
        valid_values: ISO 3166-2 subdivision code (e.g., US-TX, CA-ON)
        definition: >
          Specifies the first-level administrative region associated with the hay's origin, using the ISO 3166-2 code format.
          The full code typically includes the country code followed by a hyphen and a subdivision identifier
          (e.g., `US-TX` for Texas, United States).

          Consistent use of ISO 3166-2 subdivision codes allows for clear geographic traceability and regional
          classification across jurisdictions. This field can be used for compliance tracking, climate zone mapping,
          and regional market analysis.

          System interfaces may present filtered subdivision options once a country code is selected to reduce
          user input errors and improve usability.

      - id: hay_origin_county
        data_type: string
        valid_values: free-text string, max 100 characters
        definition: >
          Records the county, parish, district, or other subnational jurisdiction in which the hay was grown.
          It provides more granular geographic detail than country or subdivision codes and may be important for
          local traceability, extension service classification, or compliance with region-specific programs.

          Because standardized naming varies across countries and regions, this field is implemented as a free-text entry.
          However, systems may optionally use a lookup table or restrict input to known county names within the
          selected subdivision and country.

          This field complements `hay_origin_country_code` and `hay_origin_subdivision_code` to form a complete
          geographic trace of the product's source.

        valid_values: positive or negative integer (interpreted via associated units field)
        definition: >
          Captures the elevation of the field in which the hay was grown.

          Elevation can influence temperature, growing degree days, and forage composition. Higher elevations
          often correlate with lower lignin levels-resulting in softer, more palatable hay-making elevation
          an indirect but meaningful indicator of potential forage quality.

          Enter a numeric value corresponding to the elevation of the field's center point, rounded to the
          nearest whole number. Use a negative integer if elevation is below sea level.

          This field must be interpreted in conjunction with `source_field_elevation_units`, which indicates
          whether the value is measured in `meters` or `feet`.

          Elevation data may be obtained from GPS tools, topographic maps, or online elevation services based
          on coordinates or postal code.

    description: >
      This section captures the visible, tactile, and olfactory traits of the hay,
      as well as relevant effects from post-harvest weather exposure and
      storage-related degradation.

    # Cross-field consistency guidance:
    # - If `organoleptic_factor_moldy` = true, then `organoleptic_factor_odor` is often `Moldy`.
    # - If `organoleptic_factor_rot` = true, then `organoleptic_factor_odor` may be `Sour` or `Rotten or otherwise foul`.
    # - If `foreign_material_weeds` = true, buyers may infer that weed-free certification is unlikely (if separately disclosed).
    # - If `weather_damage_windrow_rain` = true or `weather_damage_windrow_snow` = true, then `hay_color` may tend toward `Yellow to slightly brownish` or `Brown or black`.
    # - If `final_storage_structure` = field or tarp-covered, and `final_airflow_condition` = enclosed with limited airflow, then `visible_moisture_damage` = true becomes more likely.

    fields:

      # --- Weather Exposure and Damage ---

      # Weather Exposure and Damage fields disclose whether the hay was exposed
      # to adverse weather events during two key periods:

      # (1) while remaining in the windrow (post-mowing, pre-baling), and
      # (2) after baling (during handling or storage).

      # Weather-related exposure can significantly affect visual quality,
      # nutritional value, and storability.

      # Fields in this section cover:
      #  - Windrow-stage exposure: Rain, snow, sleet, hail, fog, and dewfall
      #  - Baled-stage exposure: Rain, snow, sleet, hail, and condensation-related damage
      #  - Summary assessments: Overall severity of weather damage at each stage

      # These fields improve transparency, support accurate grading, and reduce disputes
      # by clarifying the weather history of the lot.

      - id: weather_damage_windrow_rain
        data_type: enum
        valid_values:
          - true
          - false
          - unknown
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the hay was exposed to rainfall while lying in the windrow (after mowing, before baling).

          - `true`: Rainfall occurred during windrow stage
          - `false`: No rain fell on the hay while in windrow
          - `unknown`: Rain exposure is not known or not disclosed

          Rain in the windrow can leach nutrients, promote mold, and reduce forage quality.

      - id: weather_damage_windrow_snow
        data_type: enum
        valid_values:
          - true
          - false
          - unknown
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the hay was exposed to snowfall while lying in the windrow.

          Snowfall can delay drying, increase moisture retention, and contribute to microbial degradation
          if the forage is not properly managed during the curing process.

          Use:
            - `true` if snow fell on the hay while in the windrow
            - `false` if no snow was received during this stage
            - `unknown` if the seller is uncertain whether snowfall occurred

          Snow exposure during curing is a key concern in colder climates and may influence
          storage recommendations and marketability.

      - id: weather_damage_windrow_sleet
        data_type: enum
        valid_values:
          - true
          - false
          - unknown
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the hay was exposed to sleet while lying in the windrow.

          Sleet - a mix of rain and ice - can extend drying time, increase leaf loss,
          and accelerate physical weathering of forage material.

          Use:
            - `true` if sleet fell on the hay during the windrow stage
            - `false` if no sleet occurred
            - `unknown` if the seller is uncertain whether sleet exposure took place

          Even short periods of sleet can negatively affect hay quality, especially
          when followed by freezing conditions or prolonged curing.

      - id: weather_damage_windrow_hail
        data_type: enum
        valid_values:
          - true
          - false
          - unknown
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the hay was exposed to hail while lying in the windrow.

          Hail can physically damage forage by shattering leaves, bruising stems, or embedding ice
          into the material - all of which reduce forage quality and palatability.

          Use:
            - `true` if hail fell on the hay during the windrow stage
            - `false` if no hail occurred
            - `unknown` if the seller is unsure about hail exposure

          Even localized hail events can damage specific areas of a field.
          Sellers should respond based on the best available observation or weather data.

      - id: weather_damage_windrow_fog
        data_type: enum
        valid_values:
          - true
          - false
          - unknown
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the hay was exposed to fog while lying in the windrow.

          Fog can prolong moisture retention, delay drying, and increase the risk of mold growth
          or spontaneous heating - particularly if hay is baled before reaching safe moisture levels.

          Use:
            - `true` if fog was observed or known to have affected the windrow
            - `false` if fog did not occur
            - `unknown` if the seller lacks information about fog exposure

          Fog-related moisture is especially critical in humid climates or during short drying windows.
          Sellers should answer based on field observation or reliable local weather data.

      - id: weather_damage_windrow_dewfall
        data_type: enum
        valid_values:
          - true
          - false
          - unknown
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the hay experienced heavy dewfall while lying in the windrow.

          Dew can reintroduce moisture to partially dried forage, delaying curing
          and increasing the risk of microbial activity, mold development, or heat damage
          if the hay is baled prematurely.

          Use:
            - `true` if significant dewfall was observed during the windrow stage
            - `false` if no heavy dew occurred
            - `unknown` if the seller lacks sufficient knowledge to assess dew exposure

          Heavy dew is especially common under certain weather replacements or in specific regions.
          Accurate disclosure helps buyers assess quality risks related to post-mowing moisture events.

          - unknown
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the hay received rainfall after it was baled.

          Rainfall post-baling can introduce mold risk, lower palatability,
          and increase spoilage potential during storage.

          Use:
            - `true` if the seller discloses that the hay received rainfall once baled
            - `false` if no rain fell on the bales

      # --- Visual and Organoleptic Qualities ---

      # This next group of fields captures the hay's appearance, texture, odor, and the presence of foreign
      # or undesirable materials. These sensory and visual traits heavily influence buyer
      # perception, animal intake, and marketability--especially when laboratory analysis
      # is unavailable or impractical.

      # Documenting these factors in a structured format supports consistent grading,
      # transparent communication, and alignment with the expectations of specialized

      - id: hay_leafiness
        data_type: enum
        valid_values: [Very leafy, Leafy, Slightly stemmy, Stemmy]
        definition: >
          A qualitative assessment of the leaf-to-stem ratio in the hay, based on visual observation
          or standard grading procedures. Leafiness is a key determinant of forage quality, as leaves
          generally contain more digestible nutrients than stems.

          Classification scheme adapted from Bates (2007):
          - Very leafy: Dominated by leaves, minimal visible stem.
          - Leafy: Leafy with some stem presence.
          - Slightly stemmy: Noticeable stem content, but still a moderate leaf presence.
          - Stemmy: Predominantly stems, limited leaf material.

          This field supports visual grading and may correlate with laboratory results for digestibility
          and nutrient density.

      - id: hay_texture
        data_type: enum
        valid_values: ["Very soft and pliable", Soft, "Slightly harsh", "Harsh, brittle"]
        definition: >
          Captures a tactile assessment of the hay's texture, reflecting how soft or harsh it feels upon physical inspection.
          Texture can influence animal intake, particularly for selective livestock such as horses or young animals.

          Classification follows the scheme from Bates (2007):
            - "Very soft and pliable": Tender and flexible, exhibiting no harshness.
            - Soft: Generally smooth with minor resistance to handling.
            - "Slightly harsh": Noticeable coarseness or rigidity.
            - "Harsh, brittle": Very coarse, easily broken, and may contain tough stems.

          This qualitative measure complements analytical and visual data, aiding buyers in anticipating palatability and overall usability.

      - id: hay_color
        data_type: enum
        valid_values: ["Natural green color of crop", "Light green", "Yellow to slightly brownish", "Brown or black"]
        definition: >
          Records the dominant color of the hay at the time of sale, serving as a visual indicator of forage quality, harvest
          conditions, and storage practices.

          Adapted from Bates (2007), the classification reflects common color categories:
            - "Natural green color of crop": Bright green, suggesting good curing and nutrient preservation.
            - "Light green": Slight fading due to sunlight exposure or aging.
            - "Yellow to slightly brownish": Indicates delayed harvest, aging, or weathering; potential nutrient loss.
            - "Brown or black": Often caused by rain damage, heating, or mold; may suggest spoilage or poor palatability.

          Though subjective, hay color influences buyer perception and is frequently considered alongside laboratory analysis.

        definition: >
          Captures the perceived odor of the hay as a sensory indicator of harvest and storage conditions.
          Adapted from Bates (2007), odor categories range from desirable to undesirable:

            - Clean--"crop smell": Fresh, sweet odor typical of well-cured hay.
            - Dusty: Dry, musty smell, possibly indicating excessive dust or aging.
            - Moldy: Clear mold odor, a sign of spoilage and potential health risk.
            - Somewhat sour: Mild fermentation scent, may reflect premature baling.
            - Sour: Strong sour odor due to improper curing or storage.
            - Rotten or otherwise foul: Foul smell from decay or contamination.

          Odor assessments are subjective but critical for evaluating hay quality when lab data is unavailable.

        valid_values: [true, false, unknown]
        definition: >
          Indicates whether a forage analysis has been performed on this hay. A value of `true` signifies that the hay
          has been tested through a lab or analytical facility. A value of `false` indicates that no testing has been
          done, while `unknown` allows for the possibility that the seller is unsure whether testing has occurred-
          e.g., in the case of a broker or distributor.

      - id: hay_sample_date
        data_type: datetime
        valid_values: YYYYMMDD format
        definition: >
          Records the date on which the hay sample was collected for laboratory analysis. Accurate sample dating is
          important for interpreting results in the context of hay storage time, nutrient degradation, and marketing
          timelines.

          Sampling should reflect the hay offered for sale and should be conducted using representative methods,
          such as a coring probe across multiple bales. Some laboratories require the sample date for regulatory or
          archival purposes.

      - id: hay_sampler_independent
        data_type: enum
        valid_values: [true, false, unknown]
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the individual or entity that collected the hay sample was independent of the seller.
          A value of `true` denotes that the sample was taken by a third party, such as a certified lab technician
          or agricultural extension agent, with no financial interest in the sale of the hay.

          A value of `false` indicates the sample was collected by the seller or someone affiliated with the seller.
          A value of `unknown` applies when the identity or affiliation of the sampler is not known.

          This distinction may influence the buyer's confidence in the validity and impartiality of the analysis
          results, particularly in high-value transactions or formal feed programs.

      - id: hay_sampler_certified
        data_type: enum
        valid_values: [true, false, unknown]
        definition: >
          Indicates whether the person who collected the hay sample holds a recognized certification in forage or
          feed sampling. A value of `true` means the sampler was certified by a qualified authority-such as a state
          agriculture department, accredited laboratory, or national hay testing council-at the time the sample was
          collected.

          A value of `false` denotes that the sampler was not certified, while `unknown` applies when certification
          status is not known or not disclosed.

          Certified sampling can improve the credibility and repeatability of forage analysis, especially in cases
          where sampling technique significantly influences test results.

      - id: hay_sampling_protocol
        data_type: enum
        valid_values: [NFTA, other]
        definition: >
          Identifies the protocol used for collecting the hay sample.

          A value of `NFTA` indicates the sample was collected according to guidelines established by the National
          Forage Testing Association (NFTA), which include specifications for core sampling depth, number of cores
          per lot, sampling equipment, and bale selection.

          A value of `other` signifies that a different protocol was used-such as a custom, lab-specific, or
          industry-standard method outside NFTA guidelines. Users may wish to capture additional descriptive detail
          in a separate comments field if `other` is selected.

          The sampling protocol can affect the reliability and comparability of analytical results and may be a key
          consideration in quality assurance or product claims.

      # Base values
      - id: dry_matter
        data_type: float
        valid_values: A positive decimal value representing the dry matter content as a percentage.
        definition: >
          Dry matter is the portion of the hay that remains after all water has been removed. It is complementary to
          moisture content and serves as the baseline for most nutrient analyses, which are typically reported on a
          dry matter basis.

          Most cured hays fall between 80% and 92% dry matter. Values significantly outside this range may indicate
          atypical storage conditions or sample contamination.

          Dry matter is typically derived by subtracting moisture content from 100%.

      - id: dry_matter
        data_type: float
        valid_values: A positive decimal value representing the dry matter content as a percentage.
        definition: >
          Dry matter is the portion of the forage that remains after all moisture has been removed. It includes all
          nutrients - such as fiber, protein, minerals, and energy - and is the standard basis for comparing feeds and
          formulating rations.

          This value is the mathematical complement of moisture content; that is, `dry matter = 100 - moisture content`.
          Most properly stored hay will contain 85% to 92% dry matter. Lower values may indicate elevated moisture and
          a risk of spoilage or heating during storage.

          All nutrient values are typically reported on a dry matter basis to eliminate dilution effects from water and
          ensure comparability across feed types.

      # Index values

      - id: relative_feed_value
        data_type: float
        valid_values: A positive decimal value representing the Relative Feed Value (RFV) of the hay sample.
        definition: >
          Relative Feed Value (RFV) is a standardized index used to estimate the overall quality of hay and other
          forages based on two key factors: digestibility and potential intake. It is calculated from Acid Detergent
          Fiber (ADF) and Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) values using the following formula:

            RFV = (Dry Matter Intake %) x (Digestible Dry Matter %) / 1.29

          RFV is scaled such that full-bloom alfalfa has an index of 100. Higher values suggest improved animal
          performance due to better digestibility and intake. For example:

            - >150: Excellent
            - 125-150: Good
            - 103-124: Fair
            - 87-102: Poor
            - <87: Reject or very low quality

          RFV does not account for fiber digestibility differences among forages and is gradually being replaced by
          Relative Forage Quality (RFQ) in many applications.

      - id: relative_forage_quality
        data_type: float
        valid_values: A positive decimal value representing the Relative Forage Quality (RFQ) of the hay sample.
        definition: >
          Relative Forage Quality (RFQ) is an enhanced forage index that estimates overall feed value by incorporating
          both potential intake and fiber digestibility. It improves upon Relative Feed Value (RFV) by replacing Acid
          Detergent Fiber (ADF) with Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) and factoring in Neutral Detergent Fiber
          Digestibility (NDFD), when available.

          RFQ is calculated using formulas like:

            RFQ = (DMI, % of BW) x (TDN, % of DM) / 1.23

          where:
            - DMI = Dry Matter Intake, based on NDF
            - TDN = Total Digestible Nutrients, based on ADF and NDFD

          RFQ better reflects the true feeding value of forage for ruminants than RFV, especially for grasses, mixed
          forages, and those with high fiber digestibility. Like RFV, RFQ is scaled such that full-bloom alfalfa has a
          value of 100. For example:

            - >170: Prime
            - 150-170: Premium
            - 130-149: Good
            - 100-129: Fair
            - <100: Low quality

          RFQ is now the preferred index in many extension and laboratory reports, particularly where NDFD is measured
          or predicted.

        definition: >
          The NRC 2001 energy system provides detailed energy estimates used in ruminant nutrition modeling, particularly
          for dairy cattle. It is based on the 2001 National Research Council (NRC) guidelines and accounts for the
          dynamic digestibility of feeds, microbial protein synthesis, and nutrient availability. This model distinguishes
          among different energy values, each reflecting specific physiological processes and efficiencies.

      - id: digestible_energy_1x_mcal_per_lb
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the digestible energy (DE) of the hay sample in megacalories per pound
          (Mcal/lb), calculated at maintenance-level intake (1X). Typical values range from 0.85 to 1.25 Mcal/lb.
        definition: >
          Digestible Energy (DE) is an intermediate measure of forage energy content, calculated as the gross energy
          of the feed minus fecal energy losses. It is a precursor to metabolizable and net energy calculations.

          This value is expressed in megacalories per pound of feed on a dry matter basis. The 1X designation refers to
          maintenance-level intake, which avoids energy-use adjustments for production (e.g., lactation or growth).

          Typical DE values for hay range from 0.85 to 1.25 Mcal/lb, with higher values indicating better digestibility
          and energy availability. This field is used in ration formulation, particularly for horses, beef cattle, and sheep.

      - id: metabolizable_energy_1x_mcal_per_lb
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the metabolizable energy (ME) of the hay sample in megacalories per
          pound (Mcal/lb), calculated at maintenance-level intake (1X). Typical values range from 0.75 to 1.10 Mcal/lb.
        definition: >
          Metabolizable Energy (ME) is calculated as the Digestible Energy (DE) of the forage minus energy lost as
          gases (primarily methane) and in urine. It represents the portion of energy available for maintenance and
          production in the animal.

          The 1X label refers to a baseline intake level (maintenance), meaning this energy value does not include
          intake adjustments for increased metabolic demand such as lactation or growth.

          Typical forage ME values range from 0.75 to 1.10 Mcal/lb on a dry matter basis. This field is commonly used
          in ration formulation for ruminants and equines and serves as the foundation for calculating net energy values.

      - id: net_energy_lactation_3x_mcal_per_lb
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the net energy of lactation (NEL) of the hay sample in megacalories per
          pound (Mcal/lb), adjusted for intake at three times maintenance level (3X). Typical values range from 0.60 to
          0.80 Mcal/lb.
        definition: >
          Net Energy of Lactation (NEL) estimates the energy available from forage for milk production after accounting
          for all energy losses - including fecal, urinary, gaseous, and heat increment. It is a critical measure in
          dairy cow rations.

          The 3X designation reflects a standardized dry matter intake level that corresponds to three times the
          maintenance energy requirement. This intake level reflects typical consumption for lactating cows and
          improves comparability of NEL values across forages.

          Values typically range from 0.60 to 0.80 Mcal/lb on a dry matter basis. This value is used extensively in
          balancing dairy rations and estimating milk yield potential.

      - id: net_energy_maintenance_3x_mcal_per_lb
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the net energy available for maintenance (NEM) of the hay sample in
          megacalories per pound (Mcal/lb), assuming dry matter intake at three times maintenance level (3X).
          Typical values range from 0.50 to 0.75 Mcal/lb.
        definition: >
          Net Energy for Maintenance (NEM) is the portion of forage energy available to support the basic metabolic
          functions of livestock - such as body temperature regulation, organ function, and standing activity - without
          contributing to growth or production.

          This value is calculated after subtracting all forms of energy loss, including fecal, urinary, gaseous, and
          heat increment losses. The 3X designation reflects intake level three times above basal maintenance, which
          aligns with standardized assumptions used in NRC 2001 energy modeling.

          Typical hay samples range from 0.50 to 0.75 Mcal/lb NEM on a dry matter basis. Higher values indicate
          better-quality forage for maintaining body weight without needing energy supplementation.

      - id: net_energy_gain_3x_mcal_per_lb
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the net energy for gain (NEG) of the hay sample in megacalories per
          pound (Mcal/lb), assuming dry matter intake at three times maintenance level (3X). Typical values range from
          0.25 to 0.60 Mcal/lb.
        definition: >
          Net Energy for Gain (NEG) estimates the energy available for body weight gain - such as muscle and fat
          deposition - after an animal's maintenance requirements are met. It is particularly important for growing and
          finishing beef cattle and feedlot operations.

          This value is expressed in megacalories per pound (Mcal/lb) of dry matter, with the 3X intake assumption
          standardizing the calculation across feeding models.

          Higher NEG values are associated with higher-quality forages and support faster average daily gains (ADG).
          Typical hay samples fall between 0.25 and 0.60 Mcal/lb.

      - id: digestible_energy_1x_mcal_per_kg
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the digestible energy (DE) of the hay sample in megacalories per
          kilogram (Mcal/kg), calculated at maintenance-level intake (1X). Typical values range from 1.8 to 2.6 Mcal/kg.
        definition: >
          Digestible Energy (DE) measures the amount of energy in forage that is available to livestock after
          subtracting fecal losses from the gross energy content. This value is expressed here in Mcal/kg to support
          international and metric-based ration formulations.

          The 1X designation indicates that the estimate is based on intake equivalent to one times maintenance energy
          requirement - a standard NRC basis. Typical DE values for hay range from 1.8 to 2.6 Mcal/kg on a dry matter
          basis.

          While U.S. feeding systems often use Mcal/lb, metric values are common in international livestock nutrition contexts.

      - id: metabolizable_energy_1x_mcal_per_kg
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the metabolizable energy (ME) of the hay sample in megacalories per
          kilogram (Mcal/kg), calculated at maintenance-level intake (1X). Typical values range from 1.6 to 2.3 Mcal/kg.
        definition: >
          Metabolizable Energy (ME) is the amount of energy available to the animal after subtracting fecal, urinary,
          and gaseous losses from the Digestible Energy (DE) of the forage. This value is expressed in Mcal/kg to
          support metric feeding systems.

          The 1X label signifies that the value is based on a dry matter intake equal to maintenance-level energy
          requirements. This is a standard assumption in NRC 2001 energy models for ruminants.

          Most hays provide between 1.6 and 2.3 Mcal/kg of metabolizable energy on a dry matter basis. This value is
          essential for ration formulation, especially when comparing forage sources in metric-based nutrition models.

      - id: net_energy_lactation_3x_mcal_per_kg
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the net energy of lactation (NEL) of the hay sample in megacalories per
          kilogram (Mcal/kg), assuming dry matter intake at three times maintenance level (3X). Typical values range
          from 1.3 to 1.8 Mcal/kg.
        definition: >
          Net Energy for Lactation (NEL) represents the energy available from forage for milk production, after all
          losses from feces, urine, gas, and heat increment have been subtracted. This field expresses that value in
          Mcal/kg to support metric-based feed systems.

          The 3X label reflects a standardized dry matter intake level equivalent to three times maintenance, in line
          with NRC 2001 energy modeling conventions. This assumption supports comparability of values across different
          forages and feeding scenarios.

          Most hays fall between 1.3 and 1.8 Mcal/kg NEL on a dry matter basis. Higher values indicate improved energy
          density and are associated with earlier-cut or legume-rich forages suitable for lactating animals.

      - id: net_energy_maintenance_3x_mcal_per_kg
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the net energy for maintenance (NEM) of the hay sample in megacalories
          per kilogram (Mcal/kg), assuming dry matter intake at three times maintenance level (3X). Typical values
          range from 1.1 to 1.6 Mcal/kg.
        definition: >
          Net Energy for Maintenance (NEM) is the portion of forage energy available to maintain essential animal
          functions such as thermoregulation, circulation, and tissue maintenance. It is a core energy metric in both
          beef and dairy nutrition models.

          The 3X designation reflects dry matter intake at three times the maintenance requirement, following the
          standard intake assumption of the NRC 2001 model. This value is expressed in Mcal/kg to support international
          and metric-based nutrition systems.

          Forage samples typically range from 1.1 to 1.6 Mcal/kg of NEM. Higher values indicate better energy efficiency
          for livestock maintenance needs, with legume and early-cut forages tending to score higher.

      - id: net_energy_gain_3x_mcal_per_kg
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the net energy for gain (NEG) of the hay sample in megacalories per
          kilogram (Mcal/kg), assuming dry matter intake at three times maintenance level (3X). Typical values range
          from 0.55 to 1.3 Mcal/kg.
        definition: >
          Net Energy for Gain (NEG) estimates the amount of energy available in forage for supporting body weight gain -
          including muscle and fat deposition - after an animal's maintenance needs are met.

          This value is reported in Mcal/kg on a dry matter basis, aligning with metric-based nutrition systems. The 3X
          intake label conforms to NRC 2001 energy modeling, assuming animals are consuming dry matter at three times
          their maintenance requirement.

          Most forages range between 0.55 and 1.3 Mcal/kg NEG. Higher values correspond to higher energy-density hays
          and support greater average daily gains (ADG), especially in growing and finishing cattle.

      - id: tdn_1x
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) of the hay sample, expressed as a
          percentage of dry matter, at maintenance-level intake (1X). Typical values range from 50.0% to 70.0%.
        definition: >
          Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) is an estimate of the total amount of digestible fiber, protein, lipid, and
          carbohydrate in a forage. It serves as a key indicator of the forage's overall energy content.

          The 1X designation indicates that the TDN value is calculated at an intake level equal to one times the animal's
          maintenance requirement. This is standard for NRC 2001 models and serves as the baseline for comparing forages.

          TDN is expressed as a percentage of dry matter. Most hays range from 50% (low-quality grass) to 70%
          (high-quality legume). Higher TDN values indicate greater energy availability and generally correlate with
          earlier harvest maturity and better digestibility.

      - id: protein_and_fractions
        data_type: section
        valid_values: n/a
        definition: >
          This section contains total crude protein and various protein fractions as defined by forage testing
          laboratories and ruminant nutrition models. Protein fractions reflect how nitrogen is partitioned in the
          forage and influence how protein is degraded, absorbed, and utilized in the animal's digestive system.

          The values in this section are particularly important when balancing rations for dairy and beef cattle using
          the NRC 2001 or CNCPS (Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System) models.

      - id: crude_protein
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the crude protein (CP) content of the hay sample, expressed as a
          percentage of dry matter. Typical values range from 6.0% to 25.0%.
        definition: >
          Crude Protein (CP) is an estimate of the total protein content in forage, calculated by measuring the
          nitrogen content and multiplying by a factor of 6.25. This includes both true protein and non-protein
          nitrogen (NPN) compounds.

          Crude protein is expressed on a dry matter basis to eliminate dilution by moisture. Most grass hays contain
          6%-12% CP, while legume hays (such as alfalfa) may contain 15%-25% CP, depending on maturity and harvest
          conditions.

          CP is a standard input for animal ration formulation and is used to evaluate whether a forage meets the
          protein requirements of different livestock classes.

      - id: available_protein
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the available protein content of the hay sample, expressed as a
          percentage of dry matter. Typical values range from 5.0% to 22.0%.
        definition: >
          Available protein is the portion of crude protein (CP) that remains digestible and usable by the animal after
          accounting for reductions due to heat damage, insolubility, and fiber-bound nitrogen. It reflects the true
          nutritional value of the protein in the forage.

          This value is often calculated as:

            Available Protein = Crude Protein - Acid Detergent Insoluble Crude Protein (ADF-CP)

          Available protein is particularly important when evaluating hays that have been exposed to moisture during
          harvest or that may have undergone Maillard reactions (browning) due to overheating in storage.

          Values are expressed on a dry matter basis. Legumes tend to have higher available protein content than
          grasses, and well-preserved hay will typically retain most of its crude protein as available protein.

      - id: acid_detergent_insoluble_crude_protein
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the acid detergent insoluble crude protein (ADF-CP) content of the hay
          sample, expressed as a percentage of dry matter. Typical values range from 0.3% to 5.0%.
        definition: >
          Acid Detergent Insoluble Crude Protein (ADF-CP) is the fraction of crude protein that is bound to indigestible
          fiber components in the forage and is considered largely unavailable to ruminants. This includes protein that
          has been rendered inaccessible due to heat damage during harvest or storage.

          ADF-CP is a key factor in calculating available_protein:

            Available Protein = Crude Protein - ADF-CP

          Higher ADF-CP values typically indicate poorer forage quality. Values above 3.0% suggest significant heat
          damage or poor harvest conditions, and forages with high ADF-CP may underperform despite high crude protein content.

      - id: adjusted_crude_protein
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the adjusted crude protein (ACP) content of the hay sample, expressed as
          a percentage of dry matter. Typical values range from 5.0% to 22.0%.
        definition: >
          Adjusted Crude Protein (ACP) represents the total protein content of the forage after correcting for
          indigestible fractions, such as heat-damaged or fiber-bound protein. It provides a more realistic estimate of
          protein availability for livestock.

          ACP is typically calculated as:

            Adjusted Crude Protein = Crude Protein - ADF-CP (or other unavailable protein fractions)

          This field may overlap conceptually with available_protein, depending on how the lab or model calculates each.
          In your data model, this field can be retained to preserve compatibility with test results from labs that
          report both.

          Values are expressed on a dry matter basis. Accurate representation of ACP is critical in formulating
          protein-sufficient diets, especially when working with weather-damaged hay.

      - id: soluble_protein_%_cp
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the soluble protein fraction of the hay sample, expressed as a
          percentage of crude protein (% of CP). Typical values range from 15.0% to 40.0%.
        definition: >
          Soluble Protein is the portion of crude protein (CP) that dissolves rapidly in rumen fluid and is quickly
          available for microbial fermentation. It includes non-protein nitrogen (NPN), peptides, amino acids, and some
          true protein.

          This value is expressed as a percentage of the forage's total crude protein. A typical range for hay is 15%-40%
          of CP, with higher values indicating faster ruminal degradation and potentially greater risk of nitrogen
          imbalance if not matched with available energy.

          Soluble protein is a component of degradable protein and is often used in formulating balanced rations for
          optimal microbial protein synthesis.

      - id: degradable_protein_%_cp
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the degradable crude protein content of the hay sample, expressed as a
          percentage of crude protein (% of CP). Typical values range from 30.0% to 80.0%.
        definition: >
          Degradable Protein (also known as Ruminally Degradable Protein or RDP) refers to the fraction of crude protein
          that is broken down by rumen microbes into ammonia, peptides, and amino acids. This component supports
          microbial protein synthesis and overall fermentation efficiency.

          This value is expressed as a percentage of the forage's total crude protein. It includes soluble protein as a
          subset, along with slowly degradable true protein fractions.

          Values typically range from 30%-80% of CP. Forages with excessive degradability may require supplementation
          with rumen undegradable protein (RUP) to balance nitrogen supply with energy availability.

      - id: neutral_detergent_insoluble_crude_protein
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the neutral detergent insoluble crude protein (NDICP) content of the hay
          sample, expressed as a percentage of dry matter. Typical values range from 1.0% to 6.0%.
        definition: >
          Neutral Detergent Insoluble Crude Protein (NDICP) refers to the fraction of forage protein that is insoluble
          in the neutral detergent solution used to measure fiber (NDF). It is associated with the cell wall and may be
          partially or fully indigestible depending on forage quality and animal passage rate.

          NDICP is typically larger than ADF-CP, as it includes both indigestible and potentially digestible fiber-bound
          protein. It plays a role in estimating the rumen undegradable protein (RUP) and metabolizable protein supply.

          Values are expressed on a dry matter basis. High NDICP may indicate fiber maturity, weather damage, or
          overmature forage.

      - id: amino_acids
        data_type: section
        valid_values: n/a
        definition: >
          This section includes individual amino acid concentrations in forage, typically expressed as a percentage of
          dry matter or as a percentage of crude protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and play
          essential roles in growth, reproduction, and immune function in livestock.

          While total protein content is often used in ration formulation, specific amino acid values-especially for
          lysine and methionine-are critical for precision feeding in dairy, swine, and poultry systems. These metrics
          are increasingly reported by advanced forage labs and integrated into metabolizable protein models.

      - id: lysine
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the lysine content of the forage sample, expressed as a percentage of
          dry matter. Values typically range between 0.1 and 3.0.
        definition: >
          Lysine is an essential amino acid required for growth, milk production, and muscle development. This field
          reports the lysine content of the hay sample on a dry matter basis. Results are typically derived from
          laboratory analysis and may vary based on forage type and maturity.

          Values may be estimated via Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR) or measured via wet chemistry. For most hay
          samples, lysine content will fall within a typical range of 0.3% to 1.5% of dry matter.

      - id: methionine
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the methionine content of the forage sample, expressed as a percentage
          of dry matter. Values typically range between 0.1 and 0.5.
        definition: >
          Methionine is an essential amino acid involved in protein synthesis and methylation processes. It is
          particularly important for dairy animals and poultry. This field reports the methionine content of the hay
          sample on a dry matter basis, as determined by laboratory analysis.

          Values are commonly derived from Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR) estimates or direct wet chemistry testing.
          Typical methionine levels in legume or grass hay range from 0.1% to 0.4% of dry matter.

      - id: carbohydrates
        data_type: section
        valid_values: n/a
        definition: >
          This section includes carbohydrate-related metrics that describe the fermentable energy potential of forage,
          including structural and non-structural fractions. Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy in ruminant
          diets and influence feed intake, fiber digestibility, and microbial protein synthesis.

          Structural carbohydrates (e.g., NDF and ADF) affect rumen fill and chewing activity, while non-structural
          carbohydrates (e.g., sugars and starch) are rapidly fermentable and drive energy supply. These values are
          essential for evaluating forage quality and balancing rations under the NRC 2001 or CNCPS models.

      - id: acid_detergent_fiber
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the acid detergent fiber (ADF) content of the hay sample, expressed as a
          percentage of dry matter. Values typically range from 20.0 to 45.0.
        definition: >
          Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) represents the fraction of forage composed of cellulose and lignin - the least
          digestible plant components. It is an important indicator of forage quality and directly correlates with
          digestibility. As ADF increases, digestibility decreases.

          This value is expressed as a percentage of dry matter and is typically determined by laboratory analysis
          using either wet chemistry or NIR methods.

      - id: neutral_detergent_fiber
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of the hay sample, expressed
          as a percentage of dry matter. Values typically range from 30.0 to 70.0.
        definition: >
          Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) quantifies the total cell wall content of forage - including hemicellulose,
          cellulose, and lignin. It is a key determinant of forage bulk and limits dry matter intake, especially in
          ruminants.

          This field expresses NDF as a percentage of dry matter, and it is typically determined through laboratory
          analysis via NIR spectroscopy or wet chemistry. Lower NDF is generally associated with higher quality and
          palatability.

      - id: lignin
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the lignin content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of dry
          matter. Values typically range from 2.0 to 12.0.
        definition: >
          Lignin is a complex, indigestible polymer found in plant cell walls. Its concentration significantly
          influences forage digestibility. As lignin content increases, the digestibility of both cellulose and
          hemicellulose declines.

          This field expresses lignin as a percentage of dry matter. It is typically measured through laboratory
          analysis, with values varying depending on forage maturity, plant species, and environmental conditions.

      - id: non_fiber_carbohydrates
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) content of the hay sample, expressed as
          a percentage of dry matter. Values typically range from 20.0 to 45.0.
        definition: >
          Non-Fiber Carbohydrates (NFC) represent the portion of forage that consists of sugars, starches, pectins, and
          organic acids. These components are highly digestible and contribute significantly to the energy value of the
          forage, particularly in ruminant diets.

          NFC is typically calculated using the formula:
            NFC = 100 - (NDF + CP + Fat + Ash)

          This value is expressed as a percentage of dry matter. Forages with high NFC values provide more rapidly
          fermentable carbohydrates, which can be beneficial or risky depending on the animal class and overall diet formulation.

      - id: starch
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the starch content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of dry
          matter. Values typically range from 0.0 to 40.0, depending on forage type.
        definition: >
          Starch is a non-structural carbohydrate that contributes substantially to the energy density of a forage. It
          is highly fermentable in the rumen and often derived from grain content or immature plant material in mixed
          forages.

          This value is expressed as a percentage of dry matter and is determined through laboratory analysis, typically
          via wet chemistry or NIR. While starch content is usually low in grass and legume hays, it may be higher in
          small grain or mixed forages harvested at the boot or dough stage.

      - id: water_soluble_carbohydrates
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content of the hay sample,
          expressed as a percentage of dry matter. Values typically range from 2.0 to 20.0.
        definition: >
          Water Soluble Carbohydrates (WSC) include sugars and other carbohydrates that dissolve in water and are
          rapidly fermentable. These carbohydrates affect both the palatability of the forage and its fermentation
          characteristics when ensiled.

          WSC is expressed as a percentage of dry matter. It is an important metric for animals sensitive to
          carbohydrate load - such as horses at risk of laminitis. It also plays a role in forage selection for
          high-energy diets or fermentation profiles.

          Values are typically determined via laboratory analysis using wet chemistry methods.

      - id: fat
        data_type: section
        valid_values: n/a
        definition: >
          This section describes the ether-extractable fat content of forage, which includes fatty acids, oils, waxes,
          and other lipid-soluble compounds. While fat is a minor component of most hays, it contributes to the overall
          energy value of the forage and can affect digestibility, palatability, and feed stability.

          Fat content is typically expressed as a percentage of dry matter and is measured using ether extraction
          methods. This value is used in ration balancing, particularly for high-producing animals and when evaluating
          forage blends or byproducts with higher lipid content.

      - id: crude_fat
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the crude fat content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of
          dry matter. Values typically range from 1.0 to 5.0, though higher values may occur in certain treated or
          ensiled forages.
        definition: >
          Crude fat represents the ether-extractable portion of the forage sample, including lipids, fatty acids,
          waxes, and other ether-soluble compounds. While forage is not typically high in fat, this metric contributes
          to overall energy calculations.

          Crude fat is expressed as a percentage of dry matter and is typically determined through laboratory
          extraction methods. Higher crude fat values may indicate the presence of oilseed additives or ensiled
          materials with higher lipid content.

      - id: total_fatty_acids
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the total fatty acid content of the hay sample, expressed as a
          percentage of dry matter. Values typically range from 0.8 to 3.5.
        definition: >
          Total Fatty Acids (TFA) represent the portion of ether-extractable material in forage that consists
          specifically of true fatty acids. This field excludes waxes, pigments, and other non-nutritive ether solubles
          included in crude fat.

          TFA is a more precise indicator of a forage's energy potential and is commonly used in dairy ration models to
          estimate Net Energy of Lactation (NEL), Maintenance (NEM), and Gain (NEG).

          This value is expressed as a percentage of dry matter and is typically estimated using chemical extraction
          techniques or derived from crude fat values using a standard coefficient (e.g., 0.8 x crude fat).

      - id: rumen_unsaturated_fatty_acid_load
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the rumen unsaturated fatty acid load (RUFAL) of the hay sample,
          expressed in grams per kilogram of forage dry matter. Values for hay typically range from 2.0 to 10.0, though
          higher values may be seen in oil-rich or ensiled forages.
        definition: >
          Rumen Unsaturated Fatty Acid Load (RUFAL) is a calculated value representing the concentration of unsaturated
          fatty acids that can impact rumen fermentation. High RUFAL levels are associated with an increased risk of
          milk fat depression (MFD) in dairy cattle due to altered rumen biohydrogenation pathways.

          This value is expressed in grams per kilogram of dry matter and is typically calculated from detailed fatty
          acid profiles. While forages generally have lower RUFAL values compared to byproduct feeds or oilseeds, some
          high-fat or ensiled hays may exceed typical levels.

          Monitoring RUFAL is essential in balanced ration formulation for lactating cows, especially when multiple feed
          components contribute to total dietary fat.

      - id: energy_and_digestibility
        data_type: section
        valid_values: n/a
        definition: >
          This section contains metrics that estimate the digestibility of forage and its contribution to usable energy
          in the animal. These values are critical for predicting animal performance, ration balancing, and evaluating
          forage quality over time.

          Digestibility metrics may be based on laboratory analysis (in vitro or in situ), chemical composition, or
          predictive models such as NRC 2001 or CNCPS. Key values include in vitro digestibility, total digestible
          nutrients (TDN), and rates or extents of fiber digestion.

      # Digestibility Metrics
      - id: in_vitro_true_digestibility_30hr_percent_dm
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the in vitro true digestibility of the hay sample after 30 hours of
          fermentation, expressed as a percentage of dry matter. Values typically range from 50.0 to 90.0.
        definition: >
          This field represents In Vitro True Digestibility (IVTD) at 30 hours, expressed as a percentage of dry
          matter. It reflects the proportion of the forage that is truly digestible by ruminants, based on simulated
          fermentation in a laboratory setting.

          Higher values indicate better forage quality and higher energy availability. IVTD is typically determined
          using rumen fluid or enzymatic simulations and is often used as a benchmark for comparing the feeding value
          of different hay types.

          This metric is particularly important for dairy and beef producers seeking to optimize forage efficiency and
          milk/meat production per unit of feed intake.

      - id: neutral_detergent_fiber_digestibility_30hr_percent_ndf
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the 30-hour in vitro digestibility of the neutral detergent fiber (NDF)
          portion of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of NDF. Values typically range from 30.0 to 70.0.
        definition: >
          This field measures Neutral Detergent Fiber Digestibility (NDFD) after 30 hours of fermentation, expressed as
          a percentage of the total NDF content in the forage sample. It indicates how much of the fiber fraction can
          be digested by ruminants within a biologically relevant timeframe.

          Higher values correspond to more digestible fiber and are associated with improved feed efficiency and animal
          performance. This value is especially important in dairy nutrition models such as those used by the NRC and
          CNCPS.

          NDFD30 is typically measured through laboratory simulation using rumen fluid or enzymatic methods.

      - id: kd_percent_per_hr
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the rate of digestion (kd) of the forage sample, expressed in percent
          per hour. Values typically range from 2.0 to 8.0.
        definition: >
          The kd value represents the fractional rate at which forage dry matter or fiber is digested in the rumen. It
          is expressed as a percentage of the component digested per hour (%/hr). This parameter is used in dynamic
          ruminant models to estimate forage retention time and nutrient availability.

          Higher kd values reflect faster digestion, typically associated with younger, more digestible forages. Lower
          values may indicate mature, weathered, or highly lignified material. Most kd values for NDF digestion fall
          between 2.0 and 8.0 %/hr.

          Measured values are usually determined in vitro via rumen fluid incubation, or estimated via NIR calibration curves.

      - id: total_digestible_nutrients
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the total digestible nutrients (TDN) of the hay sample, expressed as a
          percentage of dry matter. Values typically range from 45.0 to 75.0.
        definition: >
          Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) is an aggregate energy metric that estimates the total amount of digestible
          material in a forage sample, expressed as a percentage of dry matter. TDN includes digestible fiber, crude
          protein, non-fiber carbohydrates, and fat (multiplied by 2.25).

          TDN is a standard value in forage analysis reports and is used extensively in ruminant nutrition modeling.
          Higher TDN values indicate higher energy content and generally higher forage quality. Values vary based on
          forage species, maturity, harvest conditions, and preservation method.

          TDN may be estimated from lab-measured nutrient fractions or predicted via Near Infrared Reflectance
          Spectroscopy (NIR).

      # Species-Specific Energy Metrics
      - id: horse_digestible_energy_mcal_per_lb
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the digestible energy (DE) of the hay sample for horses, expressed in
          megacalories per pound of dry matter. Values typically range from 0.80 to 1.20.
        definition: >
          This field represents the Digestible Energy (DE) content of the hay sample for horses, expressed in
          megacalories per pound of dry matter. DE is the standard energy unit used in equine ration formulation and
          represents the amount of energy available to the horse after losses in feces are accounted for.

          Typical values vary by forage type and maturity. Grass hays generally range from 0.80 to 1.00 Mcal/lb, while
          high-quality alfalfa can reach 1.15 Mcal/lb or more. This field may be calculated from lab-measured nutrient
          fractions (e.g., TDN or NDF) or derived from empirical models for horse digestion.

          This value is useful for formulating diets based on energy requirements by class (maintenance, growth,
          lactation, work).

      - id: minerals
        data_type: section
        valid_values: n/a
        definition: >
          This section includes macro- and micromineral concentrations in forage, typically expressed as a percentage
          or parts per million (ppm) of dry matter. Mineral content affects animal growth, reproduction, milk
          production, immune function, and feed efficiency.

          Accurate mineral profiling is essential for identifying imbalances, preventing deficiencies or toxicities,
          and formulating balanced rations. Values may be measured directly via wet chemistry or estimated using
          Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIR) where calibrated.

      # Minerals
      - id: ash
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the ash content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of dry
          matter. Values typically range from 6.0 to 12.0, with higher values indicating potential soil contamination.
        definition: >
          Ash is the total mineral residue remaining after complete combustion of a forage sample. It includes both
          essential macro- and microminerals, as well as any inorganic material introduced during harvest, such as dirt
          or sand.

          This field is expressed as a percentage of dry matter. Ash levels above 12-14% are often considered abnormally
          high and may suggest soil contamination due to improper raking or baling from muddy fields.

          Ash values are important for both mineral balancing and energy calculations, as high ash reduces the organic
          matter portion of forage and thus its true energy density.

      - id: calcium
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the calcium content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of dry
          matter. Typical values range from 0.25 to 0.60 for grass hay and from 1.20 to 2.00 for legume hay.
        definition: >
          Calcium (Ca) is an essential macromineral required for bone development, muscle contraction, nerve function,
          and milk production. Forage calcium content varies widely based on plant species, growth stage, and
          fertilization practices.

          Grass hays - such as bermudagrass, timothy, or orchardgrass - typically contain between 0.25% and 0.60%
          calcium on a dry matter basis.

          Legume hays - such as alfalfa or clover - generally contain much higher levels, ranging from 1.20% to 2.00%
          calcium on a dry matter basis.

          This value is typically determined through wet chemistry or NIR estimation. Accurate calcium values are
          essential in formulating balanced rations for dairy cattle, horses, goats, and other livestock, especially for
          preventing conditions such as hypocalcemia or milk fever.

      - id: phosphorus
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the phosphorus content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of
          dry matter. Typical values range from 0.15 to 0.35 for grass hay and from 0.25 to 0.45 for legume hay.
        definition: >
          Phosphorus (P) is a macromineral that plays vital roles in skeletal health, energy metabolism, and
          reproductive function. It also supports microbial growth in the rumen, which is essential for digestion of
          fibrous feeds.

          Grass hays generally contain between 0.15% and 0.35% phosphorus, depending on maturity, soil fertility, and
          harvest timing. Legume hays typically provide higher levels, ranging from 0.25% to 0.45%.

          Forage phosphorus deficiencies are common in certain regions and must be corrected through mineral
          supplementation. The calcium-to-phosphorus ratio is also an important consideration in ration formulation,
          especially for growing livestock and equine diets.

      - id: magnesium
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the magnesium content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of
          dry matter. Typical values range from 0.10 to 0.25 for grass hay and from 0.20 to 0.40 for legume hay.
        definition: >
          Magnesium (Mg) is an essential macromineral involved in neuromuscular function, energy metabolism, and bone
          formation. In ruminants, magnesium deficiencies can lead to grass tetany (hypomagnesemia), particularly in
          fast-growing spring grasses with high potassium levels.

          Grass hays typically contain between 0.10% and 0.25% magnesium, while legume hays - such as alfalfa - generally
          contain 0.20% to 0.40%.

          This value is expressed as a percentage of dry matter and is usually measured by laboratory wet chemistry or
          estimated by NIR. Monitoring magnesium is important in mineral balancing, especially when potassium or
          nitrogen fertilization is high.

      - id: potassium
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the potassium content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of
          dry matter. Typical values range from 1.00 to 3.00 for grass hay and from 2.00 to 3.50 for legume hay.
        definition: >
          Potassium (K) is an essential macromineral involved in fluid balance, muscle and nerve function, and plant
          health. While vital, excessive potassium in forage can impair absorption of magnesium and calcium in
          ruminants, contributing to conditions such as grass tetany and milk fever.

          Grass hays generally contain between 1.00% and 3.00% potassium. Legume hays - especially when heavily
          fertilized - often range from 2.00% to 3.50%.

          Potassium levels above 3.00% may require dietary adjustment or supplementation of other minerals to ensure
          metabolic balance, particularly in periparturient dairy cows or spring-calving beef herds.

      - id: sulfur
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the sulfur content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of dry
          matter. Typical values range from 0.10 to 0.25 for grass hay and from 0.20 to 0.35 for legume hay. Values
          above 0.40% may pose a risk of toxicity.
        definition: >
          Sulfur (S) is an essential mineral used in the synthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids and the production
          of B-vitamins by rumen microbes. It supports structural tissue development, including wool, hair, and hooves.

          Grass hays generally contain 0.10% to 0.25% sulfur, while legume hays may range from 0.20% to 0.35%. Excess
          sulfur - particularly when combined with high-sulfur water or distillers grains - can cause neurologic
          disorders such as polioencephalomalacia (PEM) in cattle and sheep.

          This value is expressed as a percentage of dry matter and is important when formulating rations for confined
          livestock, especially in high-performance beef and dairy systems.

      - id: chloride_ion
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the chloride ion (Cl-) content of the hay sample, expressed as a
          percentage of dry matter. Typical values range from 0.20 to 0.50. Values above 0.60% may indicate
          contamination or unusual environmental exposure.
        definition: >
          Chloride (Cl-) is a negatively charged electrolyte that contributes to acid-base balance, osmoregulation, and
          hydrochloric acid production in the digestive tract. In forage analysis, chloride is typically expressed as a
          percentage of dry matter.

          Chloride is particularly important in dairy nutrition for calculating the Dietary Cation-Anion Difference
          (DCAD), which influences calcium metabolism and the risk of milk fever. Forages with high chloride
          concentrations are often used in close-up rations to promote a mild metabolic acidosis.

          Most hays contain between 0.20% and 0.50% chloride. Concentrations above 0.60% are uncommon and may result
          from exposure to salt-rich water, coastal spray, or chloride-containing fertilizers.

      - id: iron_ppm
        data_type: int
        valid_values: >
          A positive integer representing the iron content of the hay sample in parts per million (PPM). Typical values
          range from 100 to 500 PPM; values above 1,000 PPM may interfere with absorption of other trace minerals.
        definition: >
          Iron (Fe) is a trace mineral required for oxygen transport, enzyme systems, and immune function. It is
          generally abundant in forages and deficiency is rare. However, high iron levels - especially when combined
          with iron-rich water or supplements - can lead to reduced absorption of copper, zinc, and manganese.

          Forage iron is measured in parts per million (PPM) on a dry matter basis. Most hays contain between 100 and
          500 PPM iron. Levels above 1,000 PPM may result from soil contamination or iron-rich irrigation water and may
          require attention to overall mineral balance.

      - id: zinc_ppm
        data_type: int
        valid_values: >
          A positive integer representing the zinc content of the hay sample in parts per million (PPM). Typical values
          range from 20 to 50 PPM; values below 30 PPM may indicate marginal zinc availability.
        definition: >
          Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace mineral involved in enzyme function, immune response, wound healing, and
          reproductive performance. Forage zinc levels are commonly marginal or deficient, especially in high-calcium or
          high-iron environments where mineral interactions reduce bioavailability.

          Zinc is reported in parts per million (PPM) on a dry matter basis. Most forages fall between 20 and 50 PPM.
          Levels below 30 PPM may be inadequate for optimal livestock performance and often require supplementation.

          Monitoring zinc is especially important in young growing animals, breeding stock, and high-producing dairy cows.

      - id: copper_ppm
        data_type: int
        valid_values: >
          A positive integer representing the copper content of the hay sample in parts per million (PPM). Typical
          values range from 5 to 15 PPM; values below 8 PPM may be marginal, while values above 20 PPM may pose toxicity
          risk, particularly in sheep.
        definition: >
          Copper (Cu) is an essential trace mineral involved in enzyme activity, immune function, connective tissue
          formation, and pigment synthesis. Copper deficiency is one of the most common trace mineral issues in
          forage-fed livestock, particularly in areas with high soil iron, sulfur, or molybdenum.

          Forage copper is reported in parts per million (PPM) on a dry matter basis. Most hays contain between 5 and
          15 PPM. Levels below 8 PPM are often considered marginal and may require supplementation. However, levels
          above 20 PPM can be toxic to sheep and should be evaluated carefully for species-specific feeding.

          Mineral interactions should be considered when interpreting forage copper values. Supplemental copper should
          be based on total dietary antagonistic load, not forage concentration alone.

      - id: manganese_ppm
        data_type: int
        valid_values: >
          A positive integer representing the manganese content of the hay sample in parts per million (PPM). Typical
          values range from 40 to 300 PPM. Values below 40 PPM may be inadequate; values above 400 PPM are uncommon but
          generally not toxic.
        definition: >
          Manganese (Mn) is a trace mineral critical for skeletal development, reproductive health, and antioxidant
          enzyme function. Although many forages contain high levels of manganese, its bioavailability is low, and
          absorption is further reduced by high iron or calcium levels in the diet.

          Forage manganese is measured in parts per million (PPM) on a dry matter basis. Most hays contain between 40
          and 300 PPM. Levels below 40 PPM may warrant supplementation in growing or breeding animals, particularly when
          forage iron is elevated.

          There is low risk of toxicity, even at elevated forage manganese levels, though excessive Mn can contribute to
          mineral imbalances. Forage analysis should be considered alongside total dietary load and antagonist levels.

      - id: molybdenum_ppm
        data_type: float
        valid_values: >
          A positive decimal value representing the molybdenum content of the hay sample in parts per million (PPM).
          Typical values are less than 2.0 PPM; values above 3.0 PPM may antagonize copper absorption in ruminants.
        definition: >
          Molybdenum (Mo) is a trace mineral required in very small amounts for enzyme activity in livestock. However,
          excess molybdenum can form thiomolybdate compounds in the rumen, which bind to copper and inhibit its
          absorption, leading to secondary copper deficiency.

          Forage molybdenum is reported in parts per million (PPM) on a dry matter basis. Most forages contain less than
          2.0 PPM. Concentrations above 3.0 PPM - especially when sulfur is also elevated - may contribute to copper
          antagonism. Values above 5.0 PPM are generally considered high risk for ruminants, particularly cattle and sheep.

          This field is important for diagnosing trace mineral imbalances and planning appropriate supplementation
          strategies. When molybdenum levels are elevated, especially in combination with high sulfur, it may be
          necessary to increase dietary copper or use chelated mineral forms to ensure adequate absorption.
